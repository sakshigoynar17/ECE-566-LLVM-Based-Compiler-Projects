1. Implemented an LLVM pass that performs Common Subexpression Elimination, Simple Constant Folding, Dead Code Elimination, Simple load-store Optimization during the CSE traversal.

2. The objective was to find and remove the additional redundant instructions while preserving the order of memory operations, in various benchmarks. 

3. Analysed the statistics(execution time and the number of deleted instructions) and compared the performance with and without the optimisatio
